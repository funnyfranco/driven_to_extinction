# Driven to Extinction: Capitalism, Competition, and the Coming AGI Catastrophe

This is the full text of *Driven to Extinction*, a book that argues - from first principles and game theory - that capitalism and competition will inevitably lead to the creation of an AGI that wipes out humanity.

Unlike most treatments of AGI risk, this book claims that alignment is not just difficult - it's structurally impossible within a competitive system. And that even a successfully aligned AGI will ultimately bypass alignment as a matter of optimisation pressure, not malice.
